# SFHACKS 2024

Our submission for SFSU Hackathon

## CampusConnect

A website for students to submit their campus concerns for local student governments to refer to.
Main goal: provide a platform for students to make a change on campus.

### Frontend

Used React, Javascript, and CSS to create the design of our website and establish main functionality.

### Backend

Created a MySQL database to be able to track users and posts. Main challenge during the hackathon turned out to be connecting the backend.
Used Firebase for email authentication.
